                    Registration is now open!
                    Seats will be limited. Register now and be part of this great event.<br><br>
                    DrupalCamp Greece is an event by the community for the community and we want to keep it accessible to everyone.<br><br>
                    That does not change the fact that an event needs money to become reality. Show your support for the event with our love package ticket and get an event T-shirt!<br><br>
                    If you are a student or unemployed we still want you to participate. This is why we have a special bellow cost ticket price for you for 5â‚¬.
